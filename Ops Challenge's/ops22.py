# Here is a short story:

# Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.

# Your task is to:

# create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
# assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
# having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, and separate each of them with a comma;
# now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three previous variables.
# print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
# experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.).
# Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and total_apples.

#1
john = 3
mary = 5
adam = 6

print(john, mary, adam)

total_apples = john + mary + adam
#2
print(total_apples)


a = 3
b = 5
c = 6
print( a, b, c)

addition = a + b + c
subtraction = a - b - c
multiplication = a * b * c
division = a / b / c
integer_division = a // b // c

print("total apples:", total_apples)

print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)
print("Integer Division:", integer_division)
