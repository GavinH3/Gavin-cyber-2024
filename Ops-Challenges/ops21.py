# Objectives
# Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.
a=5
b=5
# Equals: a == b
if a == b:
  print("a is equal to b.")
# Not Equals: a != b
elif a != b:
  print("a is not equal to b.")
# Less than: a < b
elif a<b:
  print("a is less then b.")
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
elif a<= b:
  print("a is less than or equal to b.")
# Greater than: a > b
elif a > b:
  print("a is greater than b.")
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
elif a>= b:
  print("a is greater than or equal to b.")
# Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions met or and else when no condition is met.

else:
  print("no condition was met.")


# Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
# Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

# Create an if statement with two conditions by using and between conditions.

# Create an if statement with two conditions by using or between conditions.

# Create a nested if statement.

# Hint:  a = int(input("Enter a number "))
